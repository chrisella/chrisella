# Hey

I'm Chris, a software engineer based in Berkshire just to the West of London in the UK.

ðŸ”­ I am currently employed by [Accesso](http://accesso.com/) and have been since 2013 working on virtual queueing solutions. Recently I've been spending more time working on new solutions using machine learning.

Feel free to contact me through GitHub for any enquiries.
